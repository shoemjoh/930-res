# My Travel Blog
This is the beta of my peer-to-peer travel recommendation website that I would like to create throughout the Flatiron School Software Engineering bootcamp.
Similar use cases include Instagram notes, Indagare Travel, AMIGO; however, I would like long-form recommendations/tips to be the differentation in this site. 

# Roadmap
This project will iterate alongside my coding skill development. Eventually, I would like it to have a social network component, where you can see recommendations from your social circle for places that they have traveled, including: restaurants, hotels, activities, and tips.
